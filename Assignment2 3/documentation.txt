The program is composed of the following files:

- common.h : shared memory structure declaration and constants.
- printer.c: this program represents the print server. Each page takes 1 second to print. 
- client.c this program represents a client that sends requests to the printer.
- test-3.sh: script of clients sending printing requests.
- Makefile: when you execute ./make, this compiles all the program and produces executable files "client" and "printer".

How to run the program:
- make
- ./printer x &  => x represents the number of slots in the printer and add '&' to run the printer in the background.
- either, enter each client one by one like : ./client id pages & or ./test-3.sh , which is the script already set up wih a sequence of clients requesting the printing service.
