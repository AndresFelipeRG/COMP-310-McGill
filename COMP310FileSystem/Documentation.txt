Hi,
My name is Andres Felipe Rincon Gamboa and my ID is 260584148.
I am submitting the following files, I added the test files given by the TAs:

-sfs_api.c main file system implementation
-sfs_test.c  Jit's file.
-sfs_test2.c Jit's file.
-fuse_wrappers.c  Jit's file.
-jit_test.c  Jit's file.
-Makefile : Jit's file.
- disk_emu.c Jit's file.


header files:
- sfs_api.h
- disk_emu.h
If you get this error:
Fatal error: can't create disk_emu.o: Disk quota exceeded
you will have to delete sfs_disk.disk from the directory.
Also, there shouldnt be errors from the test files.


I succesfully passed the tests sfs_test.c, sfs_test2.c Jit's and jit_test.c. Also I compiled my file system in the  UBuntu
Trottier machines and it works. 
After doing a make clean and make, you should see the executable created ./Andres_Rincon_sfs.

Once the file system is compiled you should do:
1 . For sfs_test.c make sure to have this line uncommented SOURCES= disk_emu.c sfs_api.c sfs_test.c sfs_api.h.
  Then to execute the program do make clean, make, then ./Andres_Rincon_sfs. This might take a while and at the end there shouldnt be errors.
2.  For sfs_tes2.c and jit_test.c is the same as (1). Just uncomment the correct lines corresponding to the names of the files you want to test.

3. To test the fuse_wrappers.c make sure you created a directory in /tmp like this: mkdir -m 777 testing1  .
   Then, do make clean followed by a make. You should then execute in the terminal ./Andres_Rincon_sfs /tmp/testing1.
   Wait for the command to finish. Once it finished, before going to the directory /tmp/testing, check the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, by executing "printenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in the terminal. This variable should look like this and include the following libraries:


LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkgs/gurobi502/linux64/lib:/lib:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:/lib32/libc.so.6:/libx32/libc.so.6:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsigsegv.so.2:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsigsegv.so.2.0.3:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so


 If it doesnt, the file system  might not execute properly commands like "ls". So, you will have to modify in the direcotry ~ the files .profile and .bashrc by adding a command like this:
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkgs/gurobi502/linux64/lib:/lib:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:/lib32/libc.so.6:/libx32/libc.so.6:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsigsegv.so.2:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsigsegv.so.2.0.3:/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so

 4. Once the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set, you will have to reboot and start again from 1 or 3. 
 5. If you are here do cd /tmp/testing1, everything should work. Also, if you want to see the contents of the file system disk sfs_disk.disk, do cat sfs_disk.disk instead of vi sfs_disk.disk, vi sfs_disk.disk takes a lot of time to run, also cat sfs_disk might take a lot of time to run, so you should just stop it by doing ctrl z.


 6. Finally once you are in /tmp/testing1 do this:




[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>mkdir -m 777 testing1
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>cd testing1
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>echo "its working 1" >> file1.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>echo "its working 2" >> file2.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>echo "its working 3" >> file3.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>cat *
its working 1
its working 2
its working 3
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>rm -f file1.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
file2.txt  file3.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>cat *
its working 2
its working 3
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>rm -f file2.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
file3.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>cat *
its working 3
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>rm -f file3.txt
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>cat * <- since there ar no files, for some reason it creates a file called *.
[arinco1][lab1-7][/tmp/testing1]THEBESTCOMPANYINTHEWORLD>ls      <- XD XD
*

Thanks,
